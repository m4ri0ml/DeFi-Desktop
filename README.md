## Philosophy
At the begging I was planning to build this proyect as private-source for personal use but I believe a all-in-one open-sourced desktop GUI to view and manage the main DeFi DApps would be something that the Ethereum community would like and benefit from, so thats why I decided to create this repository and let other contribute to the proyect too! :)

### External DApp Links
Although navigating and interacting with DApps like Aave, Compound or Uniswap is fully functional keep in mind that DApp links that redirect to external pages (eg. External Documentation links, Terms of Service pages etc.) wont work!

## Support
Creating a quality framework takes a lot of time. Unlike others frameworks,
Choo is completely independently funded. We fight for our users. This does mean
however that we also have to spend time working contracts to pay the bills.
This is where you can help: by chipping in you can ensure more time is spent
improving Choo rather than dealing with distractions.
